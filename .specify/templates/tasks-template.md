# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Workflow**: Part of mandatory SpecKit workflow (Constitutional Principle XIII). Generated by `/speckit.tasks`.

**Tests**: Per Constitutional Principle XIV (TDD), tests are MANDATORY and MUST be written BEFORE implementation.

- Task format: `T###-test` (write failing test) → `T###-impl` (make test pass)
- Coverage target: 80%+ for merge to main
- Snapshot tests required for schema/URL encoding changes

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (TDD - write FIRST, ensure they FAIL) 🔴

> **TDD CYCLE**: Red (write failing test) → Green (minimal implementation) → Refactor

- [ ] T010-test [P] [US1] Unit test for [Entity1] validation in src/[path]/**tests**/[entity1].test.ts
- [ ] T011-test [P] [US1] Unit test for [Service] in src/[path]/**tests**/[service].test.ts
- [ ] T012-test [US1] Snapshot test for schema encoding in src/[path]/**tests**/[schema].test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 1 (TDD - make tests PASS) 🟢

- [ ] T010-impl [P] [US1] Implement [Entity1] model (make T010-test pass)
- [ ] T011-impl [US1] Implement [Service] (make T011-test pass, depends on T010-impl)
- [ ] T012-impl [US1] Implement schema encoding (make T012-test pass)
- [ ] T013 [US1] Refactor and cleanup (all tests must stay green)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete. Verify: all tests passing, coverage ≥80%

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (TDD - write FIRST) 🔴

- [ ] T020-test [P] [US2] Unit test for [Entity] in src/[path]/**tests**/[entity].test.ts
- [ ] T021-test [P] [US2] Unit test for [Service] in src/[path]/**tests**/[service].test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 2 (TDD - make tests PASS) 🟢

- [ ] T020-impl [P] [US2] Implement [Entity] model (make T020-test pass)
- [ ] T021-impl [US2] Implement [Service] (make T021-test pass)
- [ ] T022 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
- [ ] T023 [US2] Refactor and cleanup (all tests must stay green)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 complete. Coverage still ≥80%

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (TDD - write FIRST) 🔴

- [ ] T030-test [P] [US3] Unit test for [Entity] in src/[path]/**tests**/[entity].test.ts
- [ ] T031-test [P] [US3] Unit test for [Service] in src/[path]/**tests**/[service].test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 3 (TDD - make tests PASS) 🟢

- [ ] T030-impl [P] [US3] Implement [Entity] model (make T030-test pass)
- [ ] T031-impl [US3] Implement [Service] (make T031-test pass)
- [ ] T032 [US3] Refactor and cleanup (all tests must stay green)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories complete. Final coverage check ≥80%

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Phase FINAL: Memory Updates (MANDATORY - see CLAUDE.md Memory Bank)

**Purpose**: Update Memory Bank to keep project knowledge current

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This phase is NON-OPTIONAL per Memory Bank protocol.

- [ ] TMEM-1 Update `progress` memory with completed feature
- [ ] TMEM-2 Update `fsdRegistry` if new FSD slices created
- [ ] TMEM-3 [P] Update `systemPatterns` if new patterns introduced
- [ ] TMEM-4 [P] Update `techContext` if dependencies changed
- [ ] TMEM-5 Update `activeContext` with session summary
- [ ] TMEM-6 Verify all memory "Last Updated" dates are current

**Checkpoint**: All relevant memories updated. Feature ready for merge.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story (TDD Cycle)

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (Red phase)
- Implementation MUST be minimal to pass tests (Green phase)
- Refactor only when tests are green (Refactor phase)
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Story complete before moving to next priority
- Coverage check at each checkpoint

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (TDD)

```bash
# TDD RED PHASE: Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (write first, must fail):
Task: "T010-test: Unit test for [Entity1] in __tests__/[entity1].test.ts"
Task: "T011-test: Unit test for [Service] in __tests__/[service].test.ts"

# TDD GREEN PHASE: Launch implementations in parallel (make tests pass):
Task: "T010-impl: Implement [Entity1] (make T010-test pass)"
Task: "T011-impl: Implement [Service] (make T011-test pass)"

# TDD REFACTOR PHASE: Cleanup while keeping tests green
Task: "T013: Refactor and cleanup (all tests must stay green)"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD**: T###-test tasks MUST be written first and FAIL before T###-impl tasks
- **TDD**: Commit `[WIP]` allowed in feature branches; merge requires all tests green
- **Coverage**: Check coverage at each checkpoint, must be ≥80% before merge
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

### Deviation Tracking (Principle IX)

When marking tasks complete, **MUST** record any implementation deviations:

**Format**: `- [x] T001 [Description] | Deviation: [None | <deviation description>]`

**Record if**:

- Actual implementation differs from plan.md, spec.md, or data-model.md
- Different approach was used due to technical constraints
- Better solution discovered during implementation
- Requirements evolved during development

**Include**:

- What was planned (with artifact reference)
- What was actually done
- Why the change was made
- Impact (breaking changes, performance, security)

**Examples**:

- `- [x] T015 [US1] Implement invoice validation | Deviation: None`
- `- [x] T022 [US2] Add user settings storage | Deviation: Used Zustand persist instead of LocalStorage directly (plan.md assumed direct LocalStorage). Reason: Better persistence API + automatic serialization. Impact: None, still client-only storage per Principle I.`

**After feature completion**: Review all deviations to update spec.md, plan.md, or data-model.md accordingly.

### ROADMAP Updates (Principle IX)

Upon completing a feature or significant milestone, **MUST** update the relevant `ROADMAP_P*.md` file (P0, P1, or FUTURE):

**Required Information**:

- Feature completion status: `🟢 **Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Feature Folder**: Path to the spec folder (e.g., `specs/002-url-state-codec/`)
- **Implemented**: Brief implementation summary (what was built)
- **Deviations**: Key deviations from original plan (if any)
- **Notes**: Technical decisions or constraints encountered

**Example**:

```markdown
### P0.2 - URL State Codec & Schema Validation

**Status**: 🟢 **Completed**: 2025-11-19 **Compliance**: ✅
**Feature Folder**: `specs/002-url-state-codec/`
**Implemented**:

- ✅ InvoiceSchemaV1 TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ lz-string compression/decompression
- ✅ URL length validation (2000 bytes)
- ✅ Schema versioning with migration adapters
  **Deviations**:
- Used Zod for runtime validation instead of manual checks (better type safety)
- Added URL preview component not in original plan (UX improvement)
  **Notes**:
- All URLs under 1800 bytes in testing
- Migration adapter pattern tested with v0→v1 mock
```

**Update Location**: Find the feature in the relevant `ROADMAP_P*.md` file and update its status block.
