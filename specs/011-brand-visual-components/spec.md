# Feature Specification: Brand & Visual Components

**Feature Branch**: `011-brand-visual-components`
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "P0.8.2 - Brand & Visual Components: VoidLogo, NetworkBackground, Button (void variant), AuroraText, HyperText"

_Note: Generated by `/speckit.specify` command per Constitutional Principle XV (SpecKit Workflow Compliance)_

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Brand Logo Display (Priority: P1)

As a visitor to the VoidPay platform, I see the VoidLogo prominently displayed in the header and other branding locations, conveying the cosmic "black hole" theme of the application.

**Why this priority**: The logo is the primary brand identifier. Without it, the app lacks visual identity and brand recognition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering the logo component and verifying SVG structure, glow effects, and responsive sizing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the VoidLogo is rendered, **When** viewed on any screen size, **Then** the logo displays as a circular eclipse with violet glow and lightning bolts
2. **Given** the VoidLogo is rendered, **When** viewed in the header, **Then** the logo animates with a slow pulse effect on the crescent
3. **Given** the VoidLogo receives a custom className, **When** rendered, **Then** the custom classes merge with default styling

### User Story 2 - Network-Themed Background Ambiance (Priority: P1)

As a user on the payment or creation page, I see a dynamic, animated background that reflects the selected blockchain network (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Ethereum, Base, or VoidPay default), providing visual context for the current network.

**Why this priority**: Network theming is critical for user orientation and reduces errors by visually confirming which network is active.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering NetworkBackground with each theme and verifying correct colors, shapes, and animations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the NetworkBackground is rendered with theme="arbitrum", **When** viewed, **Then** blue/cyan triangular shapes animate with floating motion
2. **Given** the NetworkBackground is rendered with theme="optimism", **When** viewed, **Then** red/orange circular shapes animate with pulsing motion
3. **Given** the NetworkBackground is rendered with theme="polygon", **When** viewed, **Then** purple hexagonal shapes animate with rotation
4. **Given** the NetworkBackground is rendered with theme="ethereum", **When** viewed, **Then** blue/indigo rhombus shapes animate with swaying motion
5. **Given** the NetworkBackground is rendered with theme="base", **When** viewed, **Then** blue circular shapes animate with horizontal drift
6. **Given** the NetworkBackground is rendered with theme="voidpay", **When** viewed, **Then** violet/indigo organic blob shapes animate with morphing borders
7. **Given** the theme prop changes, **When** the transition occurs, **Then** shapes crossfade smoothly over 1.5 seconds

### User Story 3 - Void Button Physics Animation (Priority: P1)

As a user about to execute a payment or critical action, I interact with the "void" button variant that features a black hole visual metaphor with spinning accretion disk, event horizon, and gravity-responsive animations.

**Why this priority**: The void button is the primary call-to-action for payments. Its physics-based animation builds anticipation and provides clear visual feedback during the payment process.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering the void button in idle, hover, loading, and disabled states and verifying each animation phase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a void button is in idle state, **When** viewed, **Then** a spinning accretion disk rotates slowly (6s cycle) with violet/white conic gradient
2. **Given** a void button is hovered, **When** the cursor enters, **Then** the accretion disk accelerates (2s cycle) and inner glow intensifies with "suction" shadow effect
3. **Given** a void button is in loading state, **When** processing, **Then** the accretion disk spins at maximum velocity (0.5s cycle), outer glow expands, and content pulses
4. **Given** a void button is disabled, **When** viewed, **Then** the accretion disk disappears, grayscale filter applies, and opacity reduces
5. **Given** a void button contains text, **When** hovered, **Then** the text compresses slightly (scale 0.95) simulating gravitational pull

### User Story 4 - Aurora Gradient Text Effect (Priority: P2)

As a user viewing headlines or promotional text, I see text with an animated aurora gradient effect that draws attention and reinforces the cosmic brand theme.

**Why this priority**: Enhances visual hierarchy and brand consistency. Not blocking core functionality but improves user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering AuroraText and verifying gradient animation, text transparency, and glow effect.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AuroraText wraps content, **When** rendered, **Then** text displays with animated violet/indigo/purple gradient cycling via background-position
2. **Given** AuroraText is rendered, **When** viewed, **Then** a subtle violet drop shadow creates depth
3. **Given** AuroraText receives custom className, **When** rendered, **Then** custom styles merge properly

---

### User Story 5 - HyperText Scramble Effect (Priority: P2)

As a user viewing dynamic text content, I see text that "decrypts" character-by-character from scrambled letters, creating a technological/mysterious reveal effect.

**Why this priority**: Adds polish to user experience. Useful for revealing invoice IDs, amounts, or status changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering HyperText and verifying character-by-character reveal animation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** HyperText renders with text="INVOICE", **When** animation plays, **Then** characters scramble randomly before settling to final letters one-by-one
2. **Given** HyperText has duration=300, **When** animation plays, **Then** the full reveal completes within approximately 300ms
3. **Given** HyperText has animateOnLoad=false, **When** rendered initially, **Then** text displays immediately without scramble animation
4. **Given** HyperText text prop changes, **When** new text is provided, **Then** scramble animation triggers for the new value
5. **Given** HyperText contains spaces or punctuation, **When** animating, **Then** spaces and punctuation remain static to prevent layout shift

### Edge Cases

- What happens when NetworkBackground receives an unknown theme string? (Falls back to Ethereum/default)
- How does VoidLogo handle very small containers? (Maintains aspect ratio, scales down)
- What happens if HyperText receives empty string? (Displays nothing, no animation)
- How does void button behave with both isLoading=true and disabled=true? (Loading state takes precedence)
- What happens when AuroraText contains very long text? (Wraps normally, gradient continues)
