# Tasks: Landing Page (Marketing + SEO)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-landing-page/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (v2.0 - UX Audit Remediation), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete)
**Workflow**: Part of mandatory SpecKit workflow (Constitutional Principle XIII). Generated by `/speckit.tasks`.

**Tests**: Per Constitutional Principle XIV (TDD), tests are MANDATORY and MUST be written BEFORE implementation.

- Task format: `T###-test` (write failing test) → `T###-impl` (make test pass)
- Coverage target: 80%+ for merge to main
- This feature is UI-focused; tests verify rendering, accessibility, and interactions

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Widget directory structure and constants per plan.md

- [ ] T001 Create src/widgets/landing/ directory structure with subdirectories: hero-section/, demo-section/, how-it-works/, why-voidpay/, footer-cta/, hooks/, constants/
- [ ] T002 [P] Create src/widgets/landing/types.ts with TypeScript types: FeatureCard, WorkflowStep, NetworkBadge, DemoInvoice
- [ ] T003 [P] Create src/widgets/landing/constants/features.ts with 6 FeatureCards: No Database, Multi-Chain, Immutable, Aesthetic First, Instant Pay, Open Standard

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)         → No dependencies
Phase 2 (Foundational)  → Depends on Phase 1 → BLOCKS all user stories
Phase 3-8 (User Stories)→ All depend on Phase 2
Phase 9 (Composition)   → Depends on all widgets complete
Phase 10 (Polish)       → Depends on Phase 9
Phase FINAL (Memory)    → Depends on Phase 10
```

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Priority | Depends On | Independent? |
|-------|----------|------------|--------------|
| US1   | P1       | Foundational only | ✅ Yes |
| US2   | P1       | US1 (CTA in hero) + Foundational | ⚠️ FooterCta is independent |
| US3   | P2       | Foundational only | ✅ Yes |
| US4   | P2       | Foundational + useDemoRotation | ✅ Yes |
| US5   | P3       | All widgets created | ❌ No |
| US6   | P3       | Page composition | ❌ No |

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1**: T002-T006 can all run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 3+4 (US1 + US2)**: Can run in parallel for independent components
```
[US1] HeroSection tests/impl ║ [US2] FooterCta tests/impl
```

**Phase 5+6 (US3 + US4)**: Can run in parallel (different widgets)
```
[US3] HowItWorks + WhyVoidPay ║ [US4] DemoSection
```

**Phase 10**: Lighthouse audits can run in parallel (T090 ║ T091 ║ T092)
